This is a web based system to simulate the renewable energy systems installed at Burwell museum.  It provides a simple simulation of the effect of adding different renewable components, and the effect of changes in the weather.

## Installation
This is a static web system.  Installation is as simple as downloading a zip file of the current code and unzipping it.  You can then just open the `www/index.html` in any modern browser and it should start running.

For use on a display then putting a browser into "kiosk mode" will hide all of the toolbars and make the main page full screen.

* [Firefox Kiosk Mode](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-enterprise-kiosk-mode)
* [Edge Kiosk Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode)
* [Chrome Kiosk Mode](https://www.appsadmins.com/blog/chrome-kiosk-mode-introduction)

The application doesn't need a keyboard (and this should not be provided so people can't exit the application), but would need either a touch-screen or mouse/trackpad to function.

## Usage
Once the app is running then you can just click on the various components to add or remove them.  You can click on the weather symbols to change the amount of sun and wind.  The system will show the flow of electricity within the system.
